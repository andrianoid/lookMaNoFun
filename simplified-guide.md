# Super Simple Installation Guide

## Windows Users

1. Download the `install.bat` file
2. Right-click the file and select "Run as administrator"
3. Wait for the installation to complete (a browser window will open automatically)

That's it! The script will:
- Install Git if needed
- Install Node.js if needed
- Download the project
- Start the development server
- Open the project in your default browser

## Mac/Linux Users

1. Download the `install.sh` file
2. Open Terminal
3. Navigate to the folder containing the downloaded file:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/downloaded/file
   ```
4. Make the script executable and run it:
   ```bash
   chmod +x install.sh
   ./install.sh
   ```

That's it! The script will handle everything else automatically.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:
1. Make sure you're running the script with administrator privileges
2. Check your internet connection
3. Contact the project maintainer if problems persist

## Uninstalling

To remove the project:
1. Delete the `lookMaNoFun` folder
